* Introduction

~bibli-paris~ is a Spacemacs layer that adds functionnalities to ~org-mode~ so
as to enable the management of reading lists of documents from Paris' network of
libraries.

* Setup

** Enabling the layer

Clone this repository in your ~.emacs.d/private/layers~ folder and enable the
layer in your ~.spacemacs~ file.

** Creating a reading list file

First, go to https://bibliotheques.paris.fr/ and look up documents you're
interested in. Select them and export your selection as a CSV file ~Export.csv~.

Next, create your reading list file =my_reading_list.org= and open it in Emacs.

Finally, call the =bibli-paris/import-from-csv= function with argument the path
to =Export.csv=.
